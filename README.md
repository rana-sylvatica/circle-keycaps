Information about 3D printable Frame1-style circular keycaps
------------------------------------------------------------

### Overview:
  There are extremely limited commercially-available options for circular keycaps that fit standard mechanical switches.
A viable alternative is 3D printing the keycaps through an online service.  Although there are numerous online 3D printing services, most of them are prohibitively expensive.  The cheapest one (as far as I know) is JLCPCB, a PCB manufacturer based in China that also offers 3D printing in several materials.

### Guide to ordering keycaps from JLC:

 - Go to jlcpcb.com

 - Click "Instant Quote"
 - Click the "3D Printing" tab
 - Upload 3D files (download from .stl_files folder)
    - Be sure to use the model with the filename corresponding to the chosen material
 - Select material/color/quantity

### Notes on materials:

There are two materials that have been tested and work well:
 - LEDO6060 resin:
    -  Extremely cheap (~$3.30 USD for 20 keycaps)
    -  Fairly durable
    -  Available in white only
    -  Smooth, matte finish
 - PA12-HP Nylon
    - More expensive (~$12.50 USD for 20 keycaps)
    - Very durable
    - Available in natural grey or dyed black
    - Textured finish
 
 ### Notes on quantities:
 
 Each file contains 10 keycaps joined by thin "sprues".  This is to get around the minimum part cost.  The keycaps can be separated with flush cutters or a sharp knife
 A standard rectangle controller in the style of B0XX or Frame1 uses 20 buttons.
 It is advisable to order an additional set (30 total keycaps) to have extras in case of quality control issues. This is rare, but with shipping time and cost, having extras just in case can be nice
 
 ### Notes on the 3D models:
 
 The two files in the .stl_files folder are similar but optimized for the material in the filename.
 The design of the keycap is heavily inspired by Haystack's "NoCap" project (https://github.com/JonnyHaystack/NoCap/)
 
### Buying from me:
 
 If you are located in the USA and would not like to wait 2 weeks for shipping from China, I have a small stock of these keycaps that I am reselling.
 
 __This will be more expensive than ordering directly from JLC__
 
 Prices are as follows:
 $0.40 per keycap for resin (I have LEDO6060 (white) and Imagine Black (black, not available on JLC))
 $0.80 per keycap for nylon (currently only have grey nylon in stock)
 
 Shipping is $3.50
